## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Media queries

### What I learned

I've primarily learned how to position things with more understanding and precision, instead of just writing down a different code and see what it does. I'm still playing around with JS though, and maybe I'll start to use jQuery soon enough.
